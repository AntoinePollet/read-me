# Project Title

Provided that you have the image in your repo, you can use a relative URL:

"  ![Alt text](/relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")   "

If you need to embed an image that's hosted elsewhere, you can use a full URL

![Alt text](http://full/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

GitHub recommend that you use relative links with the ?raw=true parameter to ensure forked repos point correctly.
